If you don't know which one and how to get it, read on. After you installed the correct version make sure [to select it](#setting-up-java-in-multimc).

## My Java Installation doesn't appear on the list, what do I do?

Try refreshing the list. If that fails, you'll need to locate the Java executable yourself - within the root Java directory this is `./bin/java` on Unix systems, and `.\bin\javaw.exe` on Windows.
